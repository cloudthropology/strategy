# Education through Content, Workshops, ...

To build an efficient product development culture teams today need to have strong
processes, team structure and engineering knowledge. We can help these teams through
Online and Offline Content, Workshops or other areas to learn those skills. Most of
that Content will be freely accessible to build mindshare and lead into direct
engagements with customers, but some of it like Workshops will be paid for.

## Process

Their management, product and engineering Team need help to learn processes
that help with faster product development. Many organisations only focus on their
engineering team or maybe product team to learn, but it should most importantly
focus on their management team so they can set the appropriate incentives and build
cultural habits necessary for a successful product company.

## Engineering and Technical

With AWS launching thousands of features a year its really hard for companies to
stay up to date and understand how they can use these features effectively. We can
help them through Online content to make sense of these new features, but also can
help them directly to decide if specific new features or services are something
that could help them with a particular problem. We need to be seen as THE experts
when it comes to great understanding of the AWS ecosystem and especially how a
Serverless infrastructure is going to be managed on AWS.

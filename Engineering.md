# Engineering Consulting

To help teams release their product or new features in their product quickly we can
help them with direct engineering consulting so they can move faster in the beginning
while we help them transition their stack or culture. The goal of our Engineering
consulting should be that they don't need us as quickly as possible and can work self
sufficiently. If we create a dependency onto us we wont be setting them up for fast
success.

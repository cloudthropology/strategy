# Cloudthropology Strategy

Software is at the core of most business today, especially large companies. They
get massive competition from smaller companies that can deliver better products
through better software and product building expertise. E.g. Uber, Netflix, Amazon
and others have severely impacted large companies.

We will focus on mid to large scale organisations (>20 developers at least) that
already have meaningful cloud deployments and want to move faster with their products.
By combining past history of building Continuous Delivery and open source tooling for
AWS infrastructure management and by recruiting from the Open Source and Consulting
community we can get a lot of knowledge together to help our customers.

Many of those large companies are fully aware of this and are trying to move into
the Cloud (especially AWS) including a Serverless environment to limit the complexity
of infrastructure they have to deal with.

They also want to create a culture and internal habits that help with rapid iterations,
fast development cycles and releases.

This transition is not easy though, so they need help on different fronts

1. [Education](./Education.md)
2. [Tooling](./Tooling.md)
3. [Engineering Consulting](Engineering.md)

Neglecting any of those areas would mean we're not setting those companies up to
succeed without us in the future. If we give their engineering teams great tools
and help them implement first versions, but don't help them to build a good internal
product development culture they will not be effective. This will always fall back
on us as we're then seen as consultants who didn't help them.

Our most important goal is to make our Customers successful without needing our help
in the future. Only then will they have enough trust in us to come back in the
future and willing to afford our more expensive prices because its worth it.

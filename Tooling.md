# Tooling

Setting up Automation on AWS is still tricky for many teams. Too often manual interaction
is used to configure AWS services. Especially when teams want to reach a Serverless
setup it becomes tough for teams to figure out what tools are best to use.

We have to deliver either a good selection of existing tools or build our own FOSS
tools where necessary to make sure Teams have a very easy time to get started with a fully
automated setup on AWS with a Serverless infrastructure.

Important Problems to tackle on AWS:

* Strong and automated default security setup on AWS
* Automated way to bring good defaults into your AWS setup
* Continuous Delivery on AWS through various services
* Self healing Serverless infrastructure
* Automated error detection and reporting
* Making sure every service (even if just launched) can be used through Cloudformation
